Execute node dbInit.js to create the database tables. 
Unless you make a change to the models, you'll never need to touch the file again. 
If you do make a change to a model, 
you can execute node dbInit.js --force or node dbInit.js -f to force sync your tables. 
It's important to note that this will empty out and remake your model tables.
